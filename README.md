This map depicts nuclear facilities and the number of reactors at each facility in the United States. It is a bivariate map created for the purpose of showing which states have the highest number of reactors. Based on the data in the map, you can see that the states with the highest number of reactors are Illinois and Pennsylvania. The eastern United States has the highest concentration of facilities and reactors. You can zoom in and out on the map using the buttons in the upper left-hand corner. 
Data for the nuclear facilities and reactor locations comes from the US EPA website. The state boundaries shapefile come from ArcGIS Online. 
This map was created by Jessica McClelland at Appalachian State Universityâ€™s Geography Department for the purpose of locating states with the highest number of nuclear reactors.
